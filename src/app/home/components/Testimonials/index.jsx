                                    Dr. Nawaz is amazing! He really cares about his patients and
                                    is always available for questions. He will also not recommend
                                    crazy procedures just to empty your pocket. I have been going
                                    to him for years now and really trust him. He is professional,
                                    courteous and Kind. You cannot find a better dentist in
                                    Ashurn, Sterling, Reston area!

                                    This office is amazing. He is very honest and very detail
                                    oriented. He is a true health care provider and doesnt focus
                                    on the business aspect of dentistry. I recommend him 100%.

                                                Was recommended to go here by a friend and he was very
                                                kind, understanding and helpful after I had told him
                                                about my wisdom tooth situation. He even help
                                                recommended me to another oral surgeon who may take
                                                medicaid. He himself no longer takes medicaid and I came
                                                in for a consultant and was ready to pay after he had
                                                made recommendation and to my surprise he said it was
                                                free of charge! I know it wasn't much since I only came
                                                in for a consultation and he did take a look at my teeth
                                                but there are some places who charge you even for small
                                                session so I am very grateful to him for his kindness.
